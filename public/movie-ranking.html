<h1>The Best (Comfort) Movies According to Jimena</h1>
<h2>My top comfort movies that can be rewatched over and over again.</h2>

<hr/>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
    <p>The soundtrack in this movie is what I listen to when I study. I love beautiful animation as well.</p>
<h3>Pride and Prejudice (2005)</h3>
    <p>I both stream this all the time, own it on Prime Video, and own it on DVD. the 1996 version is a lot
     more accurate to the book, but this version is just a cinematic masterpiece. I also study to the soundtrack.</p>
<h3>Tangled</h3>
    <p>Oh look, a classic strong disney princess who can still find love while chasing her dream
        *cough*.
