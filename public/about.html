<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jimena Romo, I'm currently a senior at the University of North Texas in Denton, Texas. I am majoring in
   Computer Science and working towards getting my certificate in Cybersecurity.</p>

<p>My main hobbies are crocheting and reading. I currently work as a coffee barista, which I've enjoyed throughout college. I am
  in the Society of Women Engineers, which aspires to inspire other women in STEM careers.  </p>

<p>I am a first generation latina student, both of my parents are immigrants from Mexico, so I study
  in order to provide them a better life, but I am also passionate about learning new things and 
  becoming better in my field.
